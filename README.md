## Overview 
This is a proof of concept that you can use interface an xbox controller to TwinCAT via ADS.  In this example we use a Python script in order to provide the controller wrapper.  

## Getting Started
First start the PLC project running.  Next run the python script on the same IPC as the TwinCAT runtime.  Finally open Desktop.view and start live view by pressing the small [L] on the right hand side.
